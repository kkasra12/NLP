# NLP Repository

This repository contains implementations of basic NLP algorithms for the Persian language, developed as part of the NLP course during my bachelor's studies. Each folder corresponds to a separate exercise.

The most complete tools and functions are available in the `5-pos/pltk` directory, which can be used as a Python package for Persian text processing.

> the word PLTK stands for *Persian Language Tool Kit* inspired by NLTK!
